# WinLogging
The WinLogging PowerShell module write windows events while also displaying to console.
When used in combination with other login modules (see below) it is possible to write
to the EventLog, a text file and console with a single command.

This module is not meant for a performance environment.

This module was inspired by David Wyatt's Logging module available here:
